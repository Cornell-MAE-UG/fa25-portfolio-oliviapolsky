#### Objective
My name is Olivia Polsky, and I’m a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I’m a member of the Concrete Canoe Mix Subteam, where I help design and formulate the concrete mix for our boat. My academic interests lie in materials science and structural design, as I enjoy exploring how material properties influence the strength and performance of engineered systems. Outside of engineering, I love playing field hockey, guitar, and spending time on creative hobbies like sewing and crocheting.
