For this ENGRD 2020 portfolio project, I designed a compact two-link hoist mechanism inside a 150 cm √ó 50 cm envelope using one rigid load bar, three pin supports (two ground-mounted), and a linear actuator. The load bar pivots about a ground pin; a short lever driven by the actuator converts the actuator‚Äôs axial force into a vertical lift at the hook while keeping the actuator primarily in tension/compression. I laid out the pins and bar to maximize the actuator‚Äôs moment arm at the hardest part of the lift, then used free-body diagrams and planar equilibrium (‚àëFx=0, ‚àëFy=0, ‚àëM=0) to size the actuator and estimate the maximum lift load. From the sketch coordinates I computed actuator length at start and top positions to get the required stroke, and I swept the motion to find the peak actuator force near the start angle (smallest moment arm). Based on those results, I tentatively selected a Tolomatic IMA33-class actuator with a suitable screw lead and stroke, leaving margin for force and kinematics. The final write-up includes the geometry, stroke calculation, the force-vs-angle check that determines ùëämax and brief notes on pin reactions, side-load avoidance, and the option of a holding brake for vertical holding.
